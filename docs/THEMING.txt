This file describes the theming functions
available for the OpenLayers module and sub modules.
Most theming is done through functions, as
opposed to template files.


 Theming Functions
=====================================
Please note that most of these functions
are well documented with inline code, and
up-to-date information and documentation
can be found on the project page.


  * theme_openlayers_map($map = array())
    --
    The basic display for the map to render in.


  * theme_openlayers_vector_styles($styles = array(), $map = array())
    --
    Does not change HTML, this is used to
    alter the main default style array.


  * theme_openlayers_behaviors_tooltip_container($behavior = array(), $map = array())
    --
    Output for tooltip containers


  * theme_openlayers_presets_ui_form_layer_description($layer_title = '', $layer_description = '')
    --
    Output for listing of layer descriptions
    in Preset UI.


  * theme_openlayers_presets_ui_form_projection_description($projection_title = '', $available_layers = array(), $layers = array())
    --
    Output for listing of projections in
    Preset UI.


  * theme_openlayers_views_feature_style($view = NULL, $row = NULL, $group = NULL)
    --
    This allow you to override the styles
    for each feature that is rendered in a view.
    Again, this does not change the output of
    HTML.
